Customizable One Roll Engine system for Foundry. Stats are fixed, everything else is an item.

Supports Expert Dice (dice with a pre-roll fixed value) and master dice (wild dice; supports only one). 

Supports multiple dice types, crudely.

## Todo
* Pretty up the interface
* Prerendered template for master dice selection instead of the kludge that exists now
* Remove roll info area from character sheet; that was a dead-end experiment
* Lofty goal: "action order" tracker that sorts everyone's rolls into a single list? Do with flags, or combat, or something.
